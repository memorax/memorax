/* Ticket spin lock from linux kernel (32 bit x86) */

/* The discussion on the mailing lists was about whether the unlocking
 * write (marked below) needed to be synchronized (fenced) or not.
 *
 * In the linux kernel the write remains synchronized when the kernel
 * is compiled for Pentium Pro and when OOSTORE is used.
